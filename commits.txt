-It is advised to commit everytime you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress.
-Type a commit to add new code, fix a typo or a bug.
Rules:
1.Use an active voice - "Fix card generator"
2.Avoid using vague messages ie saved/ updated. 
3.commit early and often .
4.Limit the subject like to 50 characters. 72 is the hard limit.
5.Begin the commit message with a capital letter
6.Do not use a period at the end of the commit message
7. Wrap the body at 72 characters. Use the body to explain when, how and why.
8. Separate subject from the body with a blank line.

Meta data - A set of data that describes and gives more information about other data.
git log - use this command to view the history of commits to a repository . This will display meta data 
(author and Date) and the commit itself.
-To find a specific line of code, use execute git log -S "line of code you are looking for" 
eg git log -S "<!DOCTYPE html>" . This will display a commit.(The value after -S is the commit made. Wrap it in 
quotation marks)
-To exit git log, type "q" or "z" (without the quotation marks)
git blame - To know who to blame for bad code.
full command : git blame file/path/resource(can even be an absolute link) eg git blame index.html
This will display the id, author, timestamp, line number and line content.
Finessing:
1. -L eg. git blame -L 1,4 links_and_images/index.html
This will restrict the output to the requested line range.
Here we have restricted the output from line 1 through 4.
2. -e eg. git blame -e links_and_images/index.html
Shows the authors email address instead of username.
3. -W eg. git blame -w links_and_images/index.html
ignores whitespace changes ie if the author just added whitespaces/newlines/switched from tabs to spaces.
4. -M eg git blame -m links_and_images/index.html
This detects moved/copied lines within the same file.
This will report the original author instead of the last author that moved/copied the lines.
5. -C eg git blame -C links_and_images/index.html
This detects lines that were moved/copied from other files.
This will report the original author instead of the last author that moved/copied the lines.
