A character set is like a digital alphabet for your browser.
It only affects how the letters are rendered and not the language of content.
The default character set for most browsers does not accommodate some special characters.
To fix this, specify a UTF-8 character encoding by adding a <meta> element with a charset attribute to the <head> element.
UTF-8 is like a universal alphabet for the internet.
