<a href="url">...</a> - An anchor tag is used to create links. It has an attribute (href). Attributes go in the opening tag and give additional information to a HTML 
element. An attribute is usually made up of two parts- Key and value. Not all attributes have values though. href(hyperlink reference) tells the browser 
the destination of the resource. When present, the href attribute gives the text a blue color and underlines it to signify that its a link. You csn use this element
to link any resource on the internet ie videos, pdfs files, images etc. Links can be absolute (links to pages on other websites on the internet ie 
protocol://domain/path) or relative(links to pages located on our own websites)

<img src="" alt="pic"> - to display an image. It is a self closing element. It embeds an image into the page using a src(source) attribute which tells the browser where the image 
file is located. The src attribute can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths. alt(alternative text) attribute describes an image. It is used in place
of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used by screen readers to describe to visually impaired users what the image is.

parent directory - A directory containing the current directory. ie links_and_images is a parent to both images and pages.
using the tree analogy, there is a parent and child analogy. The root directory is the parent directory. A subdirectory is also a parent directory when there are one or
more subdirectories below it. Each subdirectory is a child of the parent directory that is above it.

image formats :
1. jpg images -  Have .jpg file extension eg cat.jpg . They are designed to handle large color palletes without extorbitantly increasing the file size.
This makes them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. They don't allow for transparent pixels.
2. Gif images - They are the go to for simple animations. They're, however, limited in terms of color pallete. They don't allow for translucent pixels. 
This makes it hard to get high ampunts of details on a transparent background. It is better to use PNG images if you don't need animation. Have .gif extension.
3. PNG images - Have .png file extension. They are great for anything that is not an animation or a photo eg icons, logos, technical diagrams etc.
However, when PNG images are scaled up or down, they lose quality and become pixelated.
4. SVG images - Have .svg file extension. SVG is a vector based graphics format. It can scale up or down without loss of quality. They  are a great tool for responsive
design.
