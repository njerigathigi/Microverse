-HTML & CSS work together to create webpages.
-HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of eg text, buttons, links etc
-CSS is what adds style to those plain elements
-HTML puts information on a webpage, CSS adds font, color, positions it etc
-HTML and CSS are not programming languages because are not used to program
 any logic and add functionality . They are only concerned with presenting information.
