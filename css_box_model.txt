The box model has to do with positioning and layout.
Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box.
Laying out a webpage and positioning all its elements is deciding how you are going to nest and stack these boxes.
There are many ways to manipulate the size of these boxes, and the space between them, using padding, margin and border.
Padding increases the space between the edge of a box and the content inside of it.
Margin increases the space between a box(the element) and any others that sit next to it.(including the edges of the 
webpage itself).
Border adds space (even if itâ€™s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding (it fences the element).
(Watch video on padding on saved YT playlist)
eg. *{
  border: 2px solid red;
  height: 10px;
  width: 10px;
  margin: 70px;
  padding: 25px;
  border-box: auto; /* The width and height of the element take into account the padding and border measurements of
  the element. The sum of the size of the element, padding and margin with equal to the height and width */
}

-To change the shape of a box, add border-radius property.
