- CSS adds style to a HTML page.
CSS is made up of various rules. These rules are made up of a selector and a semi-colon separated list of declarations.
Each of these declarations are made up of a property:value pair.
Syntax : Selector { Property: value; } 
NB: A selector can have many property and value pairs. They are usually separated by a semi-colon (;)
NB: A <div> is a HTML element. It is an empty container.
Selector - It is the first part of a CSS rule. Selectors tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have
certain CSS Properties and values applied to them. eg * { color: red; font-style: Sans-serif } - * is the selector, color  
and font-style are the Properties and red and Sans-serif are the values.

Types of selectors:
1. Universal selector
A universal selector will select all elements  except those with specified selectors set for them
eg * { color: red; } . All elements will have the color red.

2. Type selectors
A type selector is also known as an element selector. Type selectors select all elements of the given element type.
The syntax is the name of the element eg h2{ color: blue; }

3. Class selectors
syntax: .value of the class attribute eg .flowers{ color: green; } . The value of the class attribute is case-sensitive.
Class selectors will select all elements with the given class. 
class is an attribute placed inside a HTML element eg <p class="flowers"> Hello world! </p>
You can use the same class on as many elements as you like. This is because classes aren't required to be unique.
You can add multiple classes to an element as a space separated list ie <div class="flowers pots bees"></div>.
Since space is used to separate class names, you should never use it to separate multi-worded names and should use a
hyphen instead eg <div class="flower-pot honey-bees bees-wax"></div>

4.ID selectors
Syntax: #value of the class attribute eg #unique{ color: green; }. The value of the ID attribute is case-sensitive.
An ID is an attribute that you place inside a HTML element. eg <p id="cat">meow!</p>
ID selectors select an element with the given ID.
IDs should be used sparingly ie for specificity(more on this in a few) or when you have links redirecting to a section
on the current page.
An element can only have one ID ie they are unique. An ID cannot be repeated on any single page.
The ID attribute should not have any whitespace at all.

Grouping selector

To cut down on repetition, we can group selectors that have some common declarations as a coma separated list.
eg .read{ color: red; background-color: black; /* several unique declarations*/ ;}  
.unread{ color: red; background-color: black; /* several unique declarations*/ ;} 

grouping example : .read, .unread{ color:red; background-color:black;} .read{/* several unique declarations*/;} 
unread{/*several unique declarations*/;}
-Grouping reduces repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the color or the background-color
of both classes at once.

Chaining selectors

Chaining selectors is useful when you want to apply  a certain rule to an element that has two or more specified
classes (which have their own unique declarations).
eg
<div>
  <div class="subsection header"</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">Hello world</p>
</div>

You can apply a certain CSS rule to an element that has both the subsection and preview  classes as follows:
.subsection.preview{ color: blue; } NB: There is no space between both classes (This is the syntax).
This syntax works for chaining any combination of selectors except type selectors eg h1p{} as there is no such 
HTML element.
It also works for chaining classes and IDs eg .subsection#flowers{ color: purple; }

Descendant combinators
Combinators show a relationship between selectors.
There are 4 combinators in total.
A descendant combinator is represented by a single space between selectors (The syntax is a space between selectors).
Its an ancestor and descendant kind of relationship ie child, parent, grandparent etc

eg <div class="doll">
     <div class="flower">
       <p class="heart-plants">I love plants!</p> <!-- The text will be green -->
       <p> plants are awesome!</p> <!-- The text will be purple -->
     </div>
   </div>
   <div class="doll"> <!-- Will have the declarations specified in the class (doll) applied -->
   </div>

.doll .flower{ color: green; }
.doll .flower .heart-plants{ color: purple; }
.doll{ /* several unique declarations*/ }

Avoid over-nesting to avoid confusion eg .doll .flower . heart-plants .cute-flower (etc) , as it might cause confusion.

CSS Properties

Color and Background-color 
The color property sets an element's text-color. It accepts several values eg color : red; (a keyword) and 
HSL (Hueness, Saturation and Lightness color model), HEX(The values are a special code that represents color values 
from 0 to 255) and RGB color values. (red, green, blue color values).
You can adjust the opacity by adding an alpha value. eg RGBA OR HSLA eg rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) will be a transulucent red.

eg p{
  color: red;
  
  /* rgb example */
  color: rgb((255, 0, 0));
  
  /* HEX color code */
  color: #FF0000;
  
  /* hsl example */
  color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
}
background-color sets the background color of an element.
