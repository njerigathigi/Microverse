 - All HTML documents have the same boilerplate/structure.
 - To create a HTML file, we append the filename with the extension .html 
 - The HTML file that will contain the homepage for our websites should always be named index.html.
 - This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on our websites - not having one will cause big problems.
- The <!DOCTYPE/> declaration tells the browser what version of HTML it will use to render the document.
 The latest  version of HTML is HTML5 ie <!DOCTYPE html>
 HTML4 ie <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
 You don't want to be using an older HTML version.
- After the <!DOCTYPE> declaration, we need to provide the <html> element.
 It is known as the root element of the document meaning that every other element will be a 
 descendant of it.
 This becomes important later on when we learn about manipulating HTML with JavaScript.
 The lang attribute specifies the language of the text content in that element eg <html lang="en"/>...</html>
 This attribute improves accessibility of the webpage.
 It allows assistive technologies eg screen readers to adapt according to the language and invoke correct pronunciation.
- The <head>...</head> element is where we put important meta-information(self-referencing) about our webpages.
 The <head></head> tag should not contain any element that displays content on the webpage. The following are tags included in the <head></head> tag.
 Setting the encoding is very important.It ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters
 from different languages correctly in the browser. This is done by the charset meta element <meta charset="utf-8"/> .
 The <title>...</title> element is also included in the <head>...</head> element.
 The title element is used to give the document a human readable title which is displayed in our webpage's browser tab. Excluding it would make it difficult to
 find a webpage if the user has many tabs open ie all of them would be named index.html. This is because the webpage's title would default to it's file name.
 The head element 
 - The <body> ... </body> element is the final element required to finish the html boilerplate.
 It is where all the content needed to be displayed to the users will go. ie text, images, links etc.
 The <body>...</body> element goes within the html element and is always under the <head>..</head> element
 NB: On its own, the <body>...</body> element displays nothing. You must add other elements such as <h1>..</h1> to it.

 To view your html file in the browser(using google chrome as reference):
 1. Drag and drop html file from your text editor into your browser's address bar.
 2. Find html file in your file system and double click it (to select and open it). This will open up the file in the default browser your system uses.
 3. Use the terminal :
   Ubuntu - navigate(cd) to the directory containing the file and type google-chrome index.html
   MacOs - navigate to the directory containing the file and type open ./index.html (./ means stay in the same directory)

VsCode shortcut - It only works while editing files with a .html file extension or with text files with html selected as the official language.
Enter ! on the first line and the html structure will be generated for you. (choose the first option by pressing enter)
