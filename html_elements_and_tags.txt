- HTML ~ HyperText Markup Language
- HTML opening tags <>, closing tags </> eg paragraph opening tag <p>, closing tag </p>
- Opening tags tell the browser this is the beginning of a HTML element.
- Closing tags tell the browser this is the end of a HTML element.
- HTML elements are comprised of the opening tag, content and closing tags. <p> Hi </p>. They are like containers
for content.
 The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the element contains ie is it a paragraph, 
 an image, a heading, a link etc . The browser uses that information to determine how it should interpret 
 and format the content.
- Some HTML elements do not contain closing tags eg <img>, <br>
 They are known as self-closing tags.
 some like <br> are known as empty elements because they do not wrap any content.
 - HTML has a vast list of predefined tags. Using the correct tags is important because it impacts
 how they are ranked on search engines and how accessible they are to users who rely on assistive technologies
 like screen readers to use the internet.
- Using the correct elements for HTML is called semantic HTML.
